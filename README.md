# First steps with Scala

Hi guys, I'm learning Scala, following the **"Programming in scala, 3rd edition"** book. I'll upload some _step by step_ scripts as introduction to the language. 

Feel free to contribute :)

## Requirements

You just need to download and install Scala!

## Run

You can use the command line to run the scripts, like:

    scala 01_hello.scala
